## What is Mau Mau?

It is a card game with a dedicated backend, using a Java Spring app and the Godot Engine (version 4.1.1). Players adhere to specific game rules, placing cards based on color or value, with special cards like Ace, 7, and Jack having unique rules. The game concludes when a player plays all their cards, but certain conditions can change the outcome. Branch naming conventions and setup instructions are provided.
